A basic task management , in which user can add , edit , delete tasks. User can also hightlight the urgency of a task by choose a specific color .

## Getting Started
This Todo app is implemented using Flutter (with Provider for state Management) , for data storage I had used Shared Preferences , which stores data locally .

Features:

 1. Create/edit todo
 2. Delete todo 
 3. Mark done/not done in list
 4. Enable shortcuts to create todo
